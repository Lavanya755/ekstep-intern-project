about the php file :

The given code is a PHP script that allows users to create new blog posts and displays the recently published posts on an HTML page.

Here's is the brief explanation of the code:

1. The line `session_save_path('C:\xampp\htdocs\Internproject\htmlnew\sessions')` sets the session save path to a specific directory where session files will be stored. This directory, `C:\xampp\htdocs\Internproject\htmlnew\sessions`, is used to store the session data.

2. The line `session_start()` starts the session and makes session variables available for use in the script.

3. Inside the `if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST')` condition, the script handles the form submission when the user clicks the "Publish" button.

4. The script retrieves the values submitted through the form: `$title`, `$author`, and `$content`.

5. It generates a unique filename for the blog post by concatenating the `$title` with the extension `.html`.

6. The script creates the HTML content for the blog post using the values from the form.

7. It saves the blog post as an HTML file in the directory specified by `$savePath`.

8. Next, the script stores the filename in a session variable or array (`$_SESSION['filenames']`) to keep track of the recently published posts.

9. If the number of stored filenames exceeds 5, the script removes the oldest filename from the array using `array_shift()`.

10. Moving on to the HTML part, the code presents a form where users can input the title, author, and content for a new blog post.

11. When the form is submitted, the PHP code block is executed, and the new post is saved, as described earlier.

12. If there are filenames stored in the `$_SESSION['filenames']` array, the code displays the "Recently Published" heading and then iterates over the filenames in reverse order (using `array_reverse()`) to display the most recent posts first.

13. For each filename, the code includes the corresponding HTML file by using the `include` statement with the relative file path `"htmlnew/" . $filename`.

That's a high-level overview of how the code works. It allows users to create new posts, saves them as HTML files, and displays the recently published posts on the HTML page using session storage to track the filenames.
